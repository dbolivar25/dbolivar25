# Daniel Bolivar - Computer Science at Vanderbilt University
## About Me
- My interests within computer science are mostly in backend and CLI development. These interests have led me to build several personal projects where I teach myself as I go. You can find some of my favorites pinned on this page.
- Recently, I've started learning Golang and OCaml with the aim of expanding my toolbelt.
